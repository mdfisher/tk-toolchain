Toolkit Application Runner

Launch a Toolkit application from the command line by running this tool in any
Toolkit repository.

Usage:
    tk-run-app [--project-id=<id>] [--location=<location>]

Options:

    --project-id=<id>  Specifies which project to use. If missing, the
                       non-template project with the lowest id will be
                       used.

    --location=<location>  Specifies the location where the Toolkit app is. If missing,
                           the application will assume it is run inside a repository
                           and will search for the app there.
